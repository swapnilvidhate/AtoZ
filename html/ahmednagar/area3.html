        The Mughal period was followed by half a century of Maratha rule. In 1803, Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of
        Wellington captured the Ahmendnagar Fort, but handed it over to Peshwa. the British Army firmly took possession
        of Ahmednagar in 1817 & remained thereafter. In 1830,the British Army began to arrive at Ahmednagar, which
        became a full fledged British garrison. In 1849,the local farmers complained to the collector that their
        cultivation was being destroyed by the Artillery units carrying out ball practice. The collector asked the Army
        to acquire the land being occupied by them. From 1849 to 1852, the British Army acquired 400 acres of land
        around the Fort & construction of the Cantonment commenced. As per detailed accounts published in the Ahmednagar
        Gazetteer in 1882,a batter of Field Artillery, our companies of European Infantry ,& one company of Indian
        Infantry were garrisoned at Ahmednagar at the time. In 1913 a Remount Depot was established to house 500 horses.
        By 1887,the Army had acquired a total of 559 acres of land in Ahmednagar.
