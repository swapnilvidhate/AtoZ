        Salabat Khans II Tomb (Chandbibi Mahal)
    </h1>
    <p>
        This monument is the tomb of Salabat Khan II; the minister of Muethaza I (1565-1588 AD), the later himself was a
        builder of note. This tomb is an excellent example of Nizam Shahi architecture, which indicates a departure from
        the usual single chambered square type of tomb. The tomb is locally known as Chand-bibi-ka-mahal and it is
        located on a small hill and commanding a view of the surrounding countryside. Built on a lofty octagonal terrace
        of stone about 91.44 m in width and 3.66 m in height, the tomb consists of an octagonal hall about 3.66 m across
        surrounded by a three storied verandah about 6.1 m broad, the sides of which are faced with alternate open and
        closed arches, the later being provided with a number of smaller arched opening placed symmetrically. The whole
        building rises to a height of about 21.4m.
