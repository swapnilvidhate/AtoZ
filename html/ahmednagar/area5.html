    Shukleshwar Mandir, Bhingar
    </h1>
    <p>
        This temple is about thousand years old. It is from the period of Ramayana. Bhrunghrushi’s son Shukracharya had
        done great penance (tapashcharya) to please the Lord Shankara on the west side of Samanga river. As per
        Nanasaheb Peshwe’s order Sadashiv Bhau was about to leave for the battle of Panipat to commemorate this event
        Shukleshwar temple was redevelopment and lighting tower was put in front of the temple. Maharudra abhishek was
        performed in the temple. In 1757 Nizam of Hyderabad had visited Nagar’s Fort & erected a statue of Belbhandar in
        front of Shukleshwar temple. This is mentioned by Shri Vishwas Patil in his Panipat Kadambari in reference of
        Bhingar’s Shukleshwar temple.
