        Kotla Of Twelve Imams

    </h1>
    <p>
        The remarkable mosque is called as Kotala of Bara Imams (fort of twelve saints).It was built by Burhan Nizam
        Shah in 1536 AD under the advice of his minister Shah Tahir when Burhan embraced the Shia faith. Burhan Shah
        presented the mosque to Shah Tahir and intended it as a charitable institution and collage.
        The enclosure wall (91*91 m) is built of dressed trap stone and lime. It has two entrances on the east and south
        side. Kotala of twelve Imamas is a typical example of Nizam Shahi architecture, which is famous for its carved
        decorative arch pier and arch recesses and parapet. It consists of single of a single prayer hall of three
        aisles, each having five bays deep, and has flat roof. It is very beautiful example of very well balance
        architecture, neat design, and fine workmanship.
