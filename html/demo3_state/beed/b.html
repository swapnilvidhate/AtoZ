        It is situated on the eastern hills. Built in Hemadpanti style, it is often regarded as the symbol of town. Two
        symmetrical, octagonal dīpmal (tower of light) rising 21.33 meters (70 ft) are standing in front of the temple.
        Towers have carved figures of humans and animals, now most of them defaced. There are two stories about the
        construction of this temple. One says that it was built by Sultanji Nimbalkar a Jagirdar of Nizam era. The other
        says that it was built by Mahadji Scindia. Tārīkh-e-Bīr (History of Beed) mentions it with Nimbalkar.[3]

        Kankaleshwar Temple:

    <p>
        It is perhaps the oldest and the most beautiful building in the town. Historians are not sure about the
        construction period of this temple. The architectural style suggests that it might have been constructed during
        Yadava period.,[1] most probably during the reign of Singhana (1210–47), who also founded Devagiri (Daulatabad).
        The design of this temple has some close similarities to the temples at the famous caves of Ellora. Situated in
        the middle of a small lake in the eastern part of the town, the temple is built with black stone and is carved
        with excellent human and divine figures. A fair is held in the grounds of temple during Mahashivratri.
