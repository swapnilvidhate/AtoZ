    <p>
        Sinhagad, literally means Lion’s Fort, is about 30 kilometres southwest of Pune. It was previously called
        Kondana and was also important because of its strategic location, perched on an isolated cliff in the Bhuleswar
        range of the Sahyadri Mountains, 1,312 meters above sea level. The fort is ‘naturally’ protected due to its very
        steep slopes. Walls and bastions were constructed at only key places. A good motorable road leads right up to
        the top of the fort. Apart from the excellent views of the city and the Sahaydri Mountains, the fort is also a
        popular hangout because of the vendors who sell a local delicacy called ‘pithlabhakari’ and curds. On a clear
        day one gets to see the forts of Torna, Rajgad and Purandar from Sinhagad Fort.One of the most famous battles on
        Sinhgad was fought by Tanaji Malusare, a general of Chhatrapati Shivaji of the Maratha Empire in order to
        recapture the fort in March 1670A steep cliff leading to the fort was scaled in the dead of the night with the
        help of a tamed monitor lizard named "Yashwanti", colloquially known as a ghorpad. Thereafter, a fierce battle
        ensued between Tanaji and his men versus the Mughal army headed by Udaybhan Singh Rathod. Tanaji Malusare lost
        his life. There is an anecdote that upon hearing of Tanaji's death, Chhatrapati Shivaji expressed his remorse
        with the words, "Gad aala, pan Sinha gela" - "The Fort is captured, but the Lion is lost" and so the name
        Sinhagad.A bust of Tanaji Malusare was constructed on the Fort in memory of his fierce resistance of the Mughal
        forces in the battle.
