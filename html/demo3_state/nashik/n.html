        Trimbakeshwar town is an ancient Hindu Pilgrim centre located at the source of the Godavari River, the longest
        river in peninsular India. Trimbakeshwar is abode of one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. The extraordinary feature
        of the Jyotirlinga located here is the Linga in the temple is in the form of a three faced embodying Tridev,
        Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva.

        The present Trimbakeshwar temple was constructed by third Peshwa Balaji Bajirao (1740-1760) on the site of an
        old temple. There are entry gates on all the four sides, viz. East, West, South and North. As per spiritual
        conceptions the direction East denotes the beginning, West denotes maturity, south denotes fulfillment or
        completion and the North stands for the revelation.

        In the year 1954 the Sansthan was registered under public trust registration act. Shri Trimbakeshwar Sansthan
        takes care of daily three time pooja, all the festivals and gala carnivals of the year.

    <p>
        Whenever there is a mention of a life lived ideally, there would be Ram and Sita, the divine couple who set
        standard of how relationships should be dealt with in a family and among selves. And with that occurs the names
        of places their lives spanned in. One of those places was Panchavati in the fiery forests of Dandakaranya along
        the flowing Godavari River.

        In present day, the name of the place holds much of a religious significance being associated with Lord Rama and
        his consort Sita. The reason due to which numerous individuals adorn garb of travelling pilgrim might actually
        not be comprehended precisely, but the place located in North of Nashik city in Maharashtra is a magnet in
        itself. Those who continue to draw strength from the stories of Ramayana and thus bearing the hardships of life
        as a warrior might never fail to pay a visit here at least for once in their life.
    <h5>
        History
    </h5>
    When Lord Rama and Lady Sita were asked to leave Ayodhya by beloved Step-Mother Kaikeyi under the influenced of
    Manthara her maid, the two left. However, compelled by the love for his elder brother, Lakshman also left with the
    couple on exile for 14 years. Panchavati was the place where the trio made their home while serving the exile, the
    word literally meaning 'garden of five banyan trees'. The trees could still be seen in the temple premises nearby
    Sita Gufaa. With Godavari flowing nearby, even the scary forests with roving animals became heavenly sanctity.
