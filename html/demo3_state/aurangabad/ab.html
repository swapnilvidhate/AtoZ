        The invaluable ensemble of 34 caves at Ellora in the Charanandri hills of western India’s Maharashtra State
        showcases a spirit of co-existence and religious tolerance through the outstanding architectural activities
        carried out by the followers of three prominent religions: Buddhism, Brahmanism, and Jainism. The rock-cut
        activity was carried out in three phases from the 6th century to the 12th century. The earliest caves (caves
        1–12), excavated between the 5th and 8th centuries, reflect the Mahayana philosophy of Buddhism then prevalent
        in this region. The Brahmanical group of caves (caves 13–29), including the renowned Kailasa temple (cave 16),
        was excavated between the 7th and 10th centuries. The last phase, between the 9th and 12th centuries, saw the
        excavation of a group of caves (caves 30–34) reflecting Jaina philosophy.

        Amongst the caves of the Buddhist group, Cave 10 (Visvakarma or Sutar-ki-jhopari, the Carpenter’s cave), Cave
        11, and Cave 12 (Teen Tal, or three-storied monastery, the largest in this category) are particularly important.
        These caves mark the development of the Vajrayana form of Buddhism and represent a host of Buddhist deities. The
        prominent caves of the Brahmanical group are Cave 15 (Dasavatara, or Cave of Ten Incarnations), Cave 16
        (Kailasa, the largest monolithic temple), Cave 21 (Ramesvara), and Cave 29 (Dumar Lena). Amongst these, Cave 16
        is an excellent example of structural innovation, and marks the culmination of rock-cut architecture in India
        featuring elaborate workmanship and striking proportions. The temple is decorated with some of the boldest and
        finest sculptural compositions to be found in India. The sculpture depicting Ravana attempting to lift Mount
        Kailasa, the abode of Siva, is especially noteworthy. The remains of beautiful paintings belonging to different
        periods are preserved on the ceilings of the front mandapa (pillared hall) of this temple. The Jaina group of
        caves (caves 30 – 34) is exquisitely carved with fine, delicate sculptures, and includes fine paintings
        dedicated to the Digambara sect. Through their art and architecture, the Ellora Caves serve as a window to
        ancient India, including socio-cultural phenomena, material culture, politics, and lifestyles.

        Bibi Ka Maqbara Information
    </h1>
    <img src="/IMAGE'S/download_bibi ka maqbra.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
        Built in 1668 the Tomb of Rabia Durani or Bibi Ka Maqbara was erected by Azam Shah, the son of Aurangzeb to
        commemorate his mother Dilras Begum who was titled Rabia Durani post her death. Being the spitting image of the
        Taj Mahal, the mausoleum is also called the Taj of the Deccan or the Dakkhani Taj. The north of the country is
        dotted with the specimens of the Mughal architectural magnificence, Bibi Ka Maqbara stands as a lone soul in the
        southern part. It was Aurangzeb’s long-standing governorship of Aurangabad that the shrine came to exist in the
        city and is today one of the most famous historical monuments in Maharashtra.


        <h5>Bibi Ka Maqbara History</h5>
        The story of Dilras Banu is nothing short of a fairytale. Born in the Safavid royal family of Iran, princess
        Dilras was the daughter of Shahnawaz Khan who was the then viceroy of the state of Gujarat. She married
        Aurangzeb in 1637 thus becoming his first consort and wife. Together they had five children and after delivering
        her fifth child, Dilras died. Both Aurangzeb and his eldest son, Azam Shah couldn’t bear the loss of the most
        important woman in their lives. It is said that the father-son duo were grief stricken for months and it took
        great efforts for them to come out of the state of shock. It was then in 1668 that Azam Shah ordered for a
        mausoleum to be built for his beloved mother on the lines of Taj Mahal, which was the resting place of Banu’s
        mother-in-law and Aurangzeb’s mother, Mumtaz Mahal. Both the women died because of complications developed
        through childbirth.

    Bibi Ka Maqbara Construction
</h5>
        The tomb was to be more splendid than the Taj itself but due to strict adherence to the tight budget allocated
        for the construction, the mausoleum could only result in an arduous emulation. The Mughal architects led great
        importance on having a stream passing by the structures they erected with a garden based on a Charbagh pattern.
        Bibi Ka Maqbara is no different. There was a time when River Kham could be seen flowing behind the tomb. The
        Maqbara also has a Charbagh-styled garden and it sits pretty right in the centre with structures in the four
        directions. To the north is a 12-door Baradari, south is where the main entrance is, to the west is a mosque and
        facing the east is Aina khana or the mirror chamber.

        The white dome of the Maqbara has panels adorned with intricate designs of flowers. The maqbara is graced by
        four minarets on corners with stairs leading to the tomb on three sides. The pathways are decorated with trees
        on both the sides. There is a water pool along with octagonal-shaped cisterns and the centre of the pathway
        consists of 61 fountains and 488 ft long and 96 feet broad reservoirs.
